The process is straightforward: If a file is not part of a segment, it is recreated as a common module that can be safely included in all segments. If it is segmented, it is rewritten into two parts: a segment-specific module and a remote module containing the RPC information. If a module file is included in multiple segments, a dedicated version is created for each segment.",
