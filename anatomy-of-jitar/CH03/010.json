It essentially imports the configured functions and builds the service model—what we call a segment—which contains these functions along with their metadata (for example, FQN, versions, parameters, etcetera). Note that a segment file is intended for post-processing by a bundler such as Webpack, Rollup, or similar, to generate optimized deployment bundles.",
